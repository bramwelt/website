About Me
--------
My name is Trevor Bramwell, and I am currently a student at Oregon State
University. As a Student Developer at the Oregon
State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL_), most of my time is spent working
on `Ganeti Web Manager`_: A Django web frontend for managing Ganeti_ clusters.

When I have free time, I like hacking on open source projects_, writing my book_, or dancing.
