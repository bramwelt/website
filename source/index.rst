About Me
--------
My name is Trevor Bramwell, and I am currently a student at Oregon State
University. I work as a Student Software Developer and Systems Engineer
at the Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL_). Most of my
time there has been spent working on `Ganeti Web Manager`_: A Django web
frontend for managing Ganeti_ clusters.

When I have free time, I like hacking on open source projects_, working
on my book_, or dancing.
