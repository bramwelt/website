Step #1: Deploy
===============
Or: "Deploy early, Deploy often"

Deploying web application is hard. You have packaging, testing, ci,
servers, etc. you have to manage and worry about.

But, when you start a project by deploying code, even if it's just a
noop, you have invested the time already thinking and managing your
deployment.
