Getting Started In Open Source
==============================

I have been an open source contributor for over 3 years now, and ever
since I started I have heard this question come up over and over again::

    How do I get involved in open source?

Here are 5 things I have learned through my experience that I feel will
help answer this question.

1. Scratch the Itch
-------------------

The next question I usually hear is::

    How do I choose a project to contribute to?

The answer to this question is simple: Just choose one.

Choose a project, any project, any project at all.
As long as it's something you find fun and interesting,
you won't fail in making a successful contribution.

2. Take Ownership
-----------------

Once you've found a project, tell yourself you're a contributor. Heck,
tell your parents, your significant other, your dog.  That's it, you're
a contributor now! This is the *Fake It Till You Make It* or
*Self-Fullfilling Prophecy* method.

For the first few days or weeks you commit to working on the project,
most of your time will be spent reading, not coding, not writing
documentation, not building cool things, not really *contributing*.

Telling yourself you are a contributor right away will help you get
over this initial hurdle of feeling unhelpful. Since you've already made
it, there is nothing left to prove.

3. Set Aside Time
-----------------

Time scheduled is time saved, and life is full of distractions. That
time you've been looking for, you know that time you "don't have" to
contribute to the project you want? You create that time by scheduling
it in your calendar.

When you schedule time to work on projects, you will find that time
magically appearing. It can be as little as 30 minutes, or as much as a
weekend, just as long as you schedule it. The time you think you "don't
have" exists in the many random minutes you spend browsing the web,
shopping for those shoes you don't need, reading hacker news, or
watching other people's lives go by on Facebook.

4. Provide Support
------------------

The most useful contributor is the one who builds community.

Most open source project are run by a small team of volunteers who, like
you, have a very limited supply of time. The time they have they spend
programming, or building the project, because it is the best investment
they can make. Anything other than the code gets neglected because of
this.

When you spend time providing support through IRC, email, or the bug
tracker, you learn more about the project yourself. Providing support
is alway appreciated, and will make you visible to the community and
leadership.

5. Document **ALL** the things!
-------------------------------

Through providing support you are helping people find solutions to their
problems. You might realize after a while you're solving the same
problems over and over again.

Writing these solutions down will help save time for you and others.
These can either be added to the project FAQ, or user documentation.
That way in the future you can kindly point other to the solution, and
spend your time answering other questions and documenting more
solutions.

Conclusion
----------

Finding a project that is fun and interesting to work on is the first
step in a long journey to becoming an open source contributor. Taking
ownership and setting aside time to contribute will help get you over
the initial hurdle of reading. Providing support and documenting
solutions will help others getting started with the project.

Best of luck on your contributions!
