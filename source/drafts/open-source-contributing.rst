Getting Started Contributing
============================

I have been an open source contributor for over 3 years now, and ever
since I started I have heard this question come up over and over again::

    How do I get involved in open source?

Here are 5 tips I have learned through my experience that will help
you get over that first hurdle of becoming a contributor.

1. Scratch the Itch
-------------------

All open source projects start with someone having a problem
they want solved. Whether that is an unreliable email client, a non-free
operating system, or a printer that occasionally spews garbage, all
these problems give someone an 'itch'.

Finding an 'itch' for you, even if it's in a place you can reach (i.e.
you don't have the experience), will put you on a path to success. Being
passionate about what your working on, and solving your own problems is
much more interesting and fun then solving someone elses.

2. Take Ownership
-----------------

Tell yourself you're a contributor to the project of your choice.

This can also be thought of as *Fake It Till You Make It* or a
*Self-Fullfilling Prophecy*. Don't worry about asking "How can I help?"
or "What would you like me to do?". Just tell yourself you're a
contributor and you'll be one.

.. note: You still have to put the work in.

The truth is most contributors don't have the time to invest in
mentoring. All of them have jobs and other priorities. They contribute
because they're passionate about the software, and use it regularly.

3. Set aside Time
-----------------

Time scheduled is time saved.

Life is full of distractions. That time you've been looking for, you
know that time you "don't have" to hack on the projects you want? It
will be found in that hour you spent on Facebook, Reddit, or HackerNews. 

When you schedule time to work on projects, you will find that time
magically appearing. It can be as little as 30 minutes, or as much as a
weekend, just as long as you schedule it.

4. Provide Support
------------------

The most useful contributor is the one who builds community.

Most open source project are run by a small team of volunteers who have
a limited supply of time. Few find time to invest in walking through
support requests and holding user's hands.

Any support you provide to a projects users will put you in a good light
for the users and the leadership.

5. Document **ALL** the things!
-------------------------------

The problem you just helped fix *will* come up again. Document it now;
if able, fix it.

The documentation is always lacking. Even if a project advertises 100%
API documentation coverage, their user documentation is still surly
lacking.

The best approach I've found to this is to create a *NOTES* file in the
root of the project, or have a scratchpad next to your keyboard where
you jot down notes.
